An generative AI web app that gives answers for questions

The generative AI system designed for question answering (QA) operates by utilizing advanced NLP models that process user inputs, understand their intent, and generate appropriate responses. 

The goal of this generative AI system is to answer user questions by understanding and interpreting the input, generating accurate and contextually relevant responses. It leverages a natural language processing (NLP) model trained on diverse datasets to ensure a wide range of question types can be addressed, including factual, opinion-based, and domain-specific inquiries.

The developed AI system successfully answers questions posed by users, offering concise, relevant, and well-formed responses. The system is capable of handling different types of questions with varying complexity, making it applicable in customer service, knowledge-based systems, educational tutoring, and conversational agents.
